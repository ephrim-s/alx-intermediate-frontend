Install Anywhere (npm)
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

npm install -g sass
However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so itâ€™ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!

Install on Windows (Chocolatey)
If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

choco install sass
Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)
If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

brew install sass/sass/sass
